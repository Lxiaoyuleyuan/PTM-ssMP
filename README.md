# PTM-ssMP
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are the chemical modification of a protein after its translation and they play a crucial role in regulating variety of biological processes such as cell cycle control, DNA repair, signal transduction, protein-protein interactions and so on. Since experimental methods are high-cost and time-consuming, it is necessary to develop efficient and reliable theoretical calculation method for the identification of PTMs site. Here,a novel PTM sites prediction web server, PTM-ssMP, which combined local sequence and site specific modification profile to predict human PTM sites based on SVMs. PTM-ssMP can predict nine types of human post-translational modifications phosphorylation, sulfation, lysine acetylation, ubiquitination, methylation, sumoylation, proteolytic cleavage, N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc) and O-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Comparisons with the well-known PTM sites prediction tools show that the PTM-ssMP are more competitive on PTM sites prediction, which suggests that PTM-ssMP is an effective PTM sites prediction web servers.
